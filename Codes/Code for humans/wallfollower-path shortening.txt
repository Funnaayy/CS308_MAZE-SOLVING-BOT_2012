Maze solving:

The movements get stored as followed:

left turn = “L”
right turn = “R”
turn around = “B”
go straight = “S”

These 3 letter sequences are as follows:

LBR = B
LBS = R
RBL = B
SBL = R
SBS = B
LBL =  S 

Example,

Using the left hand on the wall algorithm, here is the path the robot would take:
LLLBLLLRBLLBSRSRS 

Now here is the process of shortening that path:
LL(LBL = S)LL(RBL = B)(LBS = R)RSRS

The new path would be:
LLSLLBRRSRS

Continue shortening it until all the “B”s are gone:
LLSL(LBR = B)RSRS

The new path would be:
LLSLBRSRS

Continue shortening it:
LLS(LBR = B)SRS

The new path would be:
LLSBSRS

Continue shortening it:
LL(SBS = B)RS

The new path would be:
LLBRS

Continue shortening it:
L(LBR = B)S

The new path would be:
LBS 

The final path is:
LBS = R
